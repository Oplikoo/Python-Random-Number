# Random Number In Python
Python Guessing Random Number game
I made the code very user-friendly and theres explains before every line about what did I do there.

# How to use the code?
its really easy! just copy or download the zip folder and then run the python file that colled : "code.py"

## Any Errors?
If you have any error feel free to go to the "Issues" tab in this page.

I made this code in visual studio code, so maybe you should try to run this in visual studio code if you having trouble to run this in other softwares.

#### Requirements?
actually the only line you have never delete in the code is : ```import random```

This line is importing the random library and if this line is not exist in the code, the whole code will not even possible to run.
